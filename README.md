In India ,one of the main problem is the lack of beds in the hospital .Due to lack of beds the patients are need to stay and treated in the hospital balcony’s. To overcome this problem this coding is used .By using this coding we can check the number of beds, number of beds filled and number of available beds in every hospital in and around the state/district .By checking, the patients can be properly shifted to another hospital which has sufficient number of beds. Therefore the patients can be safely shifted to another hospital and treated properly.
